# Hi there, I'm Chris! 👋

**Full Stack Developer** | Laravel & TALL Stack 🚀  
📍 Indonesia

10 years of building web applications for Indonesian businesses. Started with plain PHP, evolved through Yii and CodeIgniter, found my groove with Laravel. Now freelancing full-time and loving it.

**My approach:** Starting simple, scaling smart, growing from prototype to production-ready systems. My GitHub is where I experiment and learn new stuff - most of my production work lives in private repos.

## 🚀 What I'm Up To

- 💼 **Full-time Freelancer** - helping Indonesian businesses build MVPs and scale them
- 🎯 Specializing in **TALL Stack** (Tailwind, Alpine, Laravel, Livewire)
- 💚 Also love **Inertia + Vue.js** with shadcn-vue for modern SPAs
- 🚀 Building **prototypes that grow into production systems**
- 🤖 Currently exploring **AI integration** (OpenAI API, n8n automation)
- 📚 GitHub repos here are for learning and experiments - check out the demo links!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Backend**
- PHP ecosystem: Plain PHP → Yii → CodeIgniter → **Laravel**
- Laravel tools: Livewire, Filament, Inertia
- Node.js, Express.js
- MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SQLite

**Frontend**
- TypeScript, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML, CSS
- **Modern stack:** Vue.js (with Inertia), shadcn-vue, Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js
- **Legacy support:** jQuery, Bootstrap (still used by many Indonesian clients)
- Ionic Angular (when needed for mobile)

**Deployment & Tools**
- Ubuntu servers, Docker
- GitHub Actions, Jenkins
- VPS (Biznet Gio, Hostinger, Cloudkilat)
- Basic DevOps (not my main strength, but I can get stuff deployed!)

## 🎯 Real-World Experience

**10 years building for Indonesian businesses:**
- 🏢 Private client applications serving hundreds of users across multiple companies
- 🚀 **MVP development** - starting simple, then scaling based on real usage
- 🔧 Full PHP evolution: plain PHP → Yii → CodeIgniter → Laravel → Lumen
- 💼 Legacy systems maintenance and modern web apps
- 📱 Occasional mobile projects (Ionic Angular + backends)

**Note:** Most of my work is in private repos (client confidentiality). My GitHub shows what I build when learning new tech!

## 🌱 Currently Exploring

- 🤖 **AI Integration** - OpenAI API and n8n workflow automation
- 🚀 **NativePHP** - early days, still buggy but interesting!
- 📊 **Laravel** - staying current with the latest version and features
- ☁️ **Modern deployment** - exploring better ways to ship apps

## 💼 Open for Work

I'm available for **freelance projects** and **full-time remote opportunities** - especially if you need help:
- **Building MVPs** that can scale (my sweet spot!)
- Laravel web applications (**TALL stack** or **Inertia + Vue** preferred)
- Starting simple, scaling smart - prototype to production
- Full-stack development from concept to deployment

Most of my experience is with Indonesian clients and local teams, but I'm eager to work with international companies too. If you're building something interesting or have a position open, let's talk!

**Work style:** Remote, flexible hours, honest about what I know and what I'm still learning.
